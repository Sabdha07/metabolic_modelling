Overview of codes for basic simulations


# MATLAB - [FBA Simulation of Monoculture and Pairwise Cultures](interaction_simulation_pairwise.m)

1. **Load the models and diet to be used**
   - Diet for monoculture (`e`) - exchange reactions is different from diet for communities (`u`) for uptake reactions.
   
2. **Find and set biomass function as objective**

3. **Use diet - `useDiet`**

4. **FBA - `optimizeCbModel`**
